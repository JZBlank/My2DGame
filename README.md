## Cat Wars (Title of game may change) 

Game Status: _**WORK IN PROGRESS**_
### Summary
Cat Wars is a 2D Java game made completely from scratch. You get to play as a cat and go on an adventure. 
This is a project that I decided to do on my free time.

Huge THANK YOU and credit to [RyiSnow's Java Game Development Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) <br/>
His videos and explanations helped me tremendously when building this game .<br/>


This is my first ever Java game and while it is still a work-in-progress, there are so many ideas I want to implement.<br/>

##### How to Play:
W - move character up <br/>
A - move character to the left <br/>
S - move character down <br/>
D - move character to the right <br/>
M - meow <br/>
P - pause <br/>
