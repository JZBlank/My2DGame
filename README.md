## Cat Wars (Title of game may change)

Cat Wars is a 2D java game made from scratch. You get to play as a cat and go on an adventure. 
This is a project that I decided to do on my free time.

His videos and explanations helped me tremendously when building this game .<br/>


This is my first ever java game and while it is still a work-in-progress, there are so many ideas I want to implement.<br/>

##### How to Play:
W - move character up <br/>
A - move character to the left <br/>
S - move character down <br/>
D - move character to the right <br/>
M - meow <br/>
P - pause <br/>

##### IMAGES: 
- Coming Soon

##### COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:
- [X] Player is able to move around in a full map 
- [X] Created an NPC
- [X] Dialogue with NPC

##### TO-DO:
- [ ] Create Game Theme Song + add Music to Game 
- [ ] Make Fishon ground move
- [ ] Create Inventory
- [ ] Make items smaller on screen
- [ ] Figure out Objective for Game (idea right now is open world, freedom to do whatever you want)
- [ ] Create full map


##### MORE IDEAS:
