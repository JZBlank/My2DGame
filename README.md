## Cat Wars (Title of game may change) 

Game Status: _**WORK IN PROGRESS**_
### Summary
Cat Wars is a 2D java game made from scratch. You get to play as a cat and go on an adventure. This is a project that I decided to do on my free time.

Huge credit to RyiSnow's Java Game Development Youtube Series. His videos and explanations helped me tremendously when building this game .

This is my first ever java game and while it is still a work-in-progress, there are so many ideas I want to implement.

##### How to Play:
W - move character up
A - move character to the left
S - move character down
D - move character to the right
M - meow
P - pause

##### IMAGES: 
- Coming Soon

##### COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:
- [X] Player is able to move around in a full map 
- [X] Created an NPC
- [X] Dialogue with NPC

##### TO-DO:
- [ ] Create Game Theme Song + add Music to Game 
- [ ] Make Fishon ground move
- [ ] Create Inventory
- [ ] Make items smaller on screen

- [ ] Create full map


##### MORE IDEAS:
