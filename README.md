## Cat Wars (Title of game may change) 

Game Status: _**WORK IN PROGRESS**_

### Summary
Cat Wars is a 2D Java game made completely from scratch. You get to play as a cat and go on an adventure. 
This is a project that I decided to do on my free time.

### Original MVP
Cat Land is littered in trash. Help the cat folks in town clean up the litter to win the ultimate reward!
